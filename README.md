# in-fit-studing
Project created at Rocketseat's free event platform

This event was focused on React specialization.

The technologies used to develop the project were ReactJS, GraphQL, GraphCMS, Apollo Client and TailwindCSS.

It was a week of classes to deepen my knowledge in the most modern technologies and accelerate your evolution towards the best opportunities in programming!
